# 'About' page for Sailfish apps

A shiny and flexible “About” page supporting license info, contributors,
changelogs, donations, etc. in your Sailfish app.

## Screenshots

TBD.

## How to use

You do not need to clone this repository if you only intend to use the module in
another project. Simply download the
[latest release bundle](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal-about/releases/latest).

### Setup

Follow the main documentation for installing Opal modules
[here](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal/blob/main/README.md#using-opal).

### Configuration

See [`doc/gallery.qml`](doc/gallery.qml) for an example. Copy the file to get
started.

### Documentation

Extensive documentation is included in the release bundle and can be added to
QtCreator via Extras → Settings → Help → Documentation → Add.

## Size

The "minified" release bundle without documentation comments takes about 40 KiB.
This is similar to a bare-bones manually built “About” page including the HTML
version of the GNU GPL v3 but without a list of contributors.

# 'About' page for Sailfish apps

A shiny and flexible "About" page supporting license info, contributors,
donations, etc. in your Sailfish app.

## Screenshots

TBD.

## How to use

You do not need to clone this repository if you only intend to use the module in
another project. Simply download the
[latest release bundle](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal-about/releases/latest).

### Setup

Follow the main documentation for installing Opal modules
[here](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal-about/blob/main/README.md).

### Configuration

See [`doc/gallery.qml`](doc/gallery.qml) for an example. Copy the file to get
started. Documentation is included in the release bundle and can be added to
QtCreator via Extras → Settings → Help → Documentation → Add.

## Size

The release bundle without documentation comments and without unnecessary files
takes about 50 KiB. In comparison, a bare-bones manually built "About" page
including the HTML version of the GNU GPL v3+ takes about 40 KiB.

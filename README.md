# 'About' page for Sailfish apps

A shiny and flexible “About” page supporting license info, contributors,
changelogs, donations, etc. in your Sailfish app.

## Screenshots

Screenshots can be found in the [doc](doc/) directory.

## Example code

A most basic but beautiful “About” page can be added with very few lines of
code:

```{qml}
import QtQuick 2.0
import Sailfish.Silica 1.0 as S
import Opal.About 1.0 as A

A.AboutPageBase {
    id: root
    allowedOrientations: S.Orientation.All
    appName: "My App"
    appIcon: Qt.resolvedUrl("../images/harbour-my-app.png")
    appVersion: "1.0.0"
    description: "My App is a simple app."
    authors: "2023 Me, Myself, and I"
    licenses: A.License { spdxId: "GPL-3.0-or-later" }
    attributions: A.OpalAboutAttribution {}
    sourcesUrl: "https://git.example.org/my-app"
}
```

Advanced features are just as easy to use and extensive documentation is
available through QtCreator.

### Note on Qmllive

`Opal.About` does not yet work properly with Qmllive.

## How to use

You do not need to clone this repository if you only intend to use the module in
another project. Simply download the
[latest release bundle](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal-about/releases/latest).

### Setup

Follow the main documentation for installing Opal modules
[here](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal/blob/main/README.md#using-opal).

### Configuration

See [`doc/gallery.qml`](doc/gallery.qml) for an example. Copy the file to get
started.

### Documentation

Extensive documentation is included in the release bundle and can be added to
QtCreator (Sailfish SDK) via Extras → Settings → Help → Documentation → Add.

## Size

The “minified” release bundle without documentation comments takes about 40 KiB.
This is similar to a bare-bones manually built “About” page including the HTML
version of the GNU GPL v3 but without a list of contributors.

## Translations

To **use** packaged translations in your project, follow the main documentation for
using Opal modules [here](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal#using-opal).

You can also **contribute** translations. Translations are managed using
[Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/opal/opal-about).
Please prefer this over pull requests (which are still welcome, of course).
If you just found a minor problem, you can also
[leave a comment in the forum](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/opal-qml-components-for-app-development/15801)
or [open an issue](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal-about/issues/new).

Please include the following details:

1. the language you were using
2. where you found the error
3. the incorrect text
4. the correct translation

See [the Qt documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-date.html#details) for
details on how to translate date formats to your local format.

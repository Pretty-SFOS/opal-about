# Changelog

## 3.0.0 (2025-08-10)

- Replaced the bundled external link handler with a new dependency on the
  [Opal.LinkHandler](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal-linkhandler) module.
  This is a drop-in replacement: simply install the link handler module and you
  are good to go. No QML changes are needed.

- The `autoAddOpalAttributions` property is now enabled by default. This means
  you no longer have to manually add Opal modules that you are using to the
  `attributions` list of your About page. All attributions properly installed
  to `qml/modules/Opal/Attributions/Opal*Attribution.qml` are loaded automatically.

- Updated translations with contents from apps using this module.
  I tried my best to always keep the most up-to-date version of all strings.
  Hopefully nothing was overwritten - I apologize for any lost work!

**Migrating to version 3.0.0:**

- Install the [Opal.LinkHandler](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal-linkhandler) module
  ([latest release](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal-linkhandler/releases/latest)).
- Make sure `autoAddOpalAttributions` is not manually disabled in your About page.
- Once `autoAddOpalAttributions` is enabled (new default), remove all manual
  attributions for Opal modules from the `attributions` property in your About page.
